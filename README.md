# Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Overview
The **Rock vs. Mine Prediction** project aims to classify underwater objects as either **rocks** or **mines** using machine learning. This classification has important applications in **marine exploration and defense**. The project leverages **logistic regression** and popular Python libraries such as **NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn** to develop an efficient and interpretable model.

## Features

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- The dataset contains features extracted from underwater objects.
- **Pandas** is used to clean, preprocess, and transform the data.
- The dataset is included in the repository for easy access.

### 2. Train-Test Split
- The dataset is split into **training** and **testing** subsets to ensure generalization.
- This allows the model to be trained on one portion and tested on unseen data.

### 3. Logistic Regression Model
- **Logistic Regression**, a widely used supervised learning algorithm, is implemented for binary classification.
- The model is trained using **Scikit-learn's implementation**.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- The model is assessed using **accuracy** for both the training and testing sets.
